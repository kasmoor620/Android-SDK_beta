# Android SDK 5.1

This repository hosts the Weemo Android SDK and accompanying
demonstration app called "SDK_Helper".   The repository as a whole can be
imported into Eclipse and it will define a project named "SDK_Helper."

If you are interested in obtaining only the Android SDK, simply copy the
subdirectory "WeemoSDK_Lib" into your own project.

The rest of this note describes how to compile and build the SDK_Helper.

## Overview

This project was made with Eclipse.  We recommend using Eclipse for building the SDK Helper to ensure a smooth experience.

Follow these 5 Step to test Weemo Technologies into a sample application.


## Run the code


### Step 0 - Install the sources

```
git clone git@github.com:weemo/Android-SDK_beta.git
```

Later, when you update the sources, use:

```
git pull
```


### Step 1 - Check Android Developement Tools

Make sure you have Android plug-in installed within Eclipse.

Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which to build Android applications.

ADT extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even export signed (or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute your application.

If you need to install ADT, please check the [official ADT website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)


### Step 2 - Install Findbugs Eclipse plug-in

FindBugsâ„¢ is a program to find bugs in Java programs. It looks for instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be errors.

While the SDK uses FindBugs, you don't have to install FindBugs to use th SDK. However, you have to install FindBugs to compile and use the Helper.

If you don't have Findbugs on your Eclipse, please download-it and intall-it. 

Follow instruction on projcet website:  [http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/](http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/)


### Step 3 - Import the project in Eclipse 

Import the Helper project in Eclipse as an "Existing Project"

</p>


### Step 4 -  Configure your mobileAppId 

To configure you mobileWebId regarding the configuration of your Profile in Weemo Portal, please edit the configuration file: 
/res/values/weemo_conf.xml

Replace your "ENTER YOUR KEY HERE" by your mobileAppId provided by Weemo:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">

    <string name="weemo_mobileAppId">ENTER YOUR KEY HERE</string>
    
</resources>
```


### Step 5 - Run the project 

This project cannot run in an Emulator, please run it on your Android mobile ARM Device.

## Using the Helper Application

The <tt>WeemoSDK-Helper</tt> can be used to set up a Weemo call
between two Android devices, or between an Android device and another
type of Weemo endpoint.  This short "HOWTO" note will describe how to
set up a test call between two Android devices.

A Weemo AppID identifies your application, and also defines a
namespace of User-IDs.  To test two endpoints, you use the same AppID
on both endpoints, and give each endpoint a unique User-ID.

<p align="center"><img

width="300"></p>

The first screen of the Android helper is where you set the AppID.
Enter the AppID given to you by Weemo and press OK.

<p align="center"><img

width="300"></p>

Set your User-ID (UID) on the second screen.  The Helper App has a
pre-defined list of users ("Kenzo Tenma", etc.) that can be convenient
to use for testing.  You can either use one of these pre-defined
users, or you can type in your own UID.  Here, we have typed
"tsheffler."  Press the "Log in" button to complete the entry of your UID.

<p align="center"><img
src="http://docs.weemo.com/img/android-sdk-5.1-helper-thirdscreen.png"
width="300"></p>

Your Display Name is the long form of your name, and is how you are
announced to other users on the system.  Type in your Display Name and
press the OK button.

<p align="center"><img

width="300"></p>

On the Call screen, you can enter the UID of another user to initiate
a test call.  You can call any UID that is connected to the Weemo
realtime platform using the same AppID as your app.  Once again, you
can choose a UID from the list of pre-defined users, or you can type
in the UID of a contact.  Press the "Call" button to make the video call.

<p align="center"><img
src="http://docs.weemo.com/img/android-sdk-5.1-helper-answerscreen.png"
width="300"></p>

If your device is the target of a video call, the "Answer Call" pop-up
will appear.  This announces the Display Name of the contact trying to
reach your device.  Press "Answer" to accept the call, or "Decline" to
cancel it.

## Changelog

This helper project is updated on an ad-hoc basis and does not necessary follows the relase agenda of the SDK.  
The best changelog is therefore the [commit log](https://github.com/weemo/Android-SDK_beta/commits/master).  
However, a simple changelog is maintained as part of the [SDK changelog](https://github.com/weemo/Android-SDK/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
